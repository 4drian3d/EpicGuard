<summary>Using the API</summary>
Make sure that EpicGuard is fully loaded before your plugin.

[Click to see the API class](https://github.com/xxneox/EpicGuard/blob/master/core/src/main/java/me/xneox/epicguard/core/EpicGuardAPI.java)

```java
// Importing the API class.
import me.xneox.epicguard.core.EpicGuardAPI;
import me.xneox.epicguard.core.manager.AttackManager;
public class EpicGuardAPIExample {
  // Accessing the EpicGuardAPI instance.
  EpicGuardAPI api = EpicGuardAPI.INSTANCE;
  // Obtaining the AttackManager instance:
  AttackManager attackManager = api.attackManager();
  // Checking if server is under attack.
  boolean isUnderAttack = attackManager.isUnderAttack();
  // checking current connections per second.
  int cps = attackManager.connectionCounter();
  
  // Checking user's country:
  String countryId = api.geoManager().countryCode("127.0.0.1");
}
